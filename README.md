The Civilization 250 is a strategy game that immerses players in the roles of historical
leaders. Each player takes turns, making decisions like move their people, build cities,
or improve their territories, all with the ultimate goal of guiding their civilization to
glorious victory.

In Civilization 250, the term “unit” encompasses any entity capable of movement on
the game map. There are four distinct types of units in the game: settlers, workers,
warriors, and archers. The military units, such as warrior and archer units, possess
the capability to engage in combat with other units. On the contrary, non-military
units, specifically settlers and workers, have different capabilities. The settlers can
establish new cities, while the workers are tasked with enhancing the terrain.

A significant portion of the game revolves around unit movement within the game world.
The world is depicted as a two-dimensional grid, and each individual cell within the
grid is referred to as a “tile”. You will march your military units to engage in conflicts
with neighboring civilizations or guide your non-military units to discover new lands
and cultivate new territory.
